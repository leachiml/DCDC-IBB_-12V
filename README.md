# DCDC-IBB_-12V
High Voltage Inverting Buck-Boost Converter +48V to -12V 2A

Based on the LM5085 from Texas Instruments

- Input: +45V to +63V DC (nominal +48V)
- Output: -12V DC (variable)
- Max. Output Current: 2A (max. 2.2A)
- Disable Jumper
- Output-On LED


### Voltage configuration

To set the voltage, turn the Trim-Potentiometer until you've reached your desired Output.

**NOTE:** Don't set Voltages below -16V, because it could damage your circuit! (If you don't replace certain Capacitors)
